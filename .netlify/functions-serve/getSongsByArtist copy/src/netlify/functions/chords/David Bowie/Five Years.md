[Verse 1]
G                                          Em
Pushing through the market square,           so many mothers sighing
A                                          C/G
News had just come over,                     we had five years left to cry in
G                                          Em
News guy wept and told us,                   earth was really dying
A                                          C/G
Cried so much his face was wet,              then I knew he was not lying

[Verse 2]
G
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
Em
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V.'s
A
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
C/G
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

[Bridge]
                Am                        C/G
And all the fat-skinny people, 
                        Am                 C/G
and all the tall-short people,
                    G                      C/G
and all the nobody people, 
                    D7
and all the somebody people
                                Am       C/G
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 3]
G                                          Em
A girl my age went off her head,            hit some tiny children
A                                          C/G
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,       I think she would have killed them
G                                          Em
A soldier with a broken arm,                fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A                                          C/G
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,and a queer Threw up at the sight of that

[Verse 4]
G                                          Em
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor,   drinking milk shakes cold and long
A                                          C/G
Smiling and waving and looking so fine,     don't think You knew you were in this song

[Bridge]
G
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
Em
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
A
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
C/G
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

[Chorus]
G
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Em
Five years, what a surprise
A
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C/G
Five years, that's all we've got
G
Five years, what a surprise
Em
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
A
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C/G
Five years, that's all we've got
G
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Em
Five years, what a surprise
A
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C/G
Five years, that's all we've got
G
Five years, what a surprise
Em
Five years, stuck on my eyes
A
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C/G
Five years, that's all we've got
G
Five years
Em
Five years
A
Five years
C/G
Five years !
G
