[Intro]
Am D G Em
Am D G Em
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am                        D
I couldn't find quiet I went out in the rain
            G                  C
I was just soakin' my head to unrattle my brain
Am                        D
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
            G             C
I didn't understand then I don't understand now
Am        D
Am I the one you think about 
             G                               C
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am        D
Am I the one you think about 
             G                               C
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
 
 Em                C
And everybody was gone 
 Em                                               C
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
 Am                            D
It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
          G                          C
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
 Am                     D
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
          G                    C
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening
Am        D
Am I the one you think about 
             G                               C
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am        D
Am I the one you think about 
             G                               C
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
 Em                C
And everybody was gone 
 Em                                               C
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack
 
       Am
I was solid gold
       D
I was in the fight
       G
I was coming back 
          C
From what seemed like a ruin
    Am
I couldn't see 
      D
You coming so far
       G
I just turn around 
     C
And there you are
Am                             D
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
           G                            C
I was just getting used to living life without you around
Am                             D
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
           G                         C
You always said I held you way too high off the ground
 
 
Am                       D
You didn't see me I was falling apart
         G                       C
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
Am                       D
You didn't see me I was falling apart
         G                       C
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
 
Am                       D
You didn't see me I was falling apart
         G                       C
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
Am                       D
You didn't see me I was falling apart
         G                       C
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
 
 
 Em                C
And everybody was gone 
 Em                                              C
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
     Em                 C
And Bona Drag was still on
Em                        C                              G   D
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Am                        C                              G   D  Am  C
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
 
 
[Outro]
 
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
A needle in a doll
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
It wasn't that at all
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
A needle in a doll
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
It wasn't that at all (when the sound kicks out)
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
A needle in a doll (when the sound kicks out)
     G                D
You said it would be painless
    Am           C
It wasn't that at all
