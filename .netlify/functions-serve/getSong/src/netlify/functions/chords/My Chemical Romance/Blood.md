[Verse 1]
            E                            F#m
Well they encourage your complete co-operation
         B                                 E     B E
Send you roses when they think you need to smile
  C#m                            F#m
I can't control myself because I don't know how
         B                             B
And they love me for it honestly, I'll be here for a while
 
 
[Chorus]
             E             F#m
So give them blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
          B                                 E
Give them all that they can drink and it'll never be enough
             E      G#m    C#m
So give them blood, blood, blooood
       B                                   E     B E
Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood
 
 
[Verse 2]
  E                          F#m
A celebrated man amongst the gurneys
         B                           E    B E
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck.
    C#m                          F#m
The doctors and the nurses they adore me so,
         B                               B (VII)
But it's really quite alarming cause I'm such an awful fuck.
 
 
[Chorus] 
           E             F#m
I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
           B                                 E
I gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough
           E      G#m    C#m
I gave you blood, blood, blood
        B                               E     B E
I'm the kind of human wreckage that you love!
